    The Process
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
      It was easy to recognize the value of Express Deals; prices were much cheaper than anything we had seen. At the time we knew it would be a success, we just needed to introduce it quickly and prove its concept with quantifiable results. We met multiple times to discuss what we were building, the problem we were solving for people and ended up with a clear strategy for launching in a month. <br><br>
      Our options were either creating a separate screen to hold the product, or just integrate an express deals unit, as a sub component, into the regular listings screen. Being able to see both retail and express deal prices on the same screen, we thought, would have a greater impact; hence we went with that.

      First success
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
  We had a decent conversion lift and thus we were ruled successful. Suddenly we had more support and time to do things. Ideas began to flow more often from different sides: product and business. But while everyone was focused on adding and changing things on desktop, we were looking to bring Express Deals to mobile, once again as fast as possible.

      Mobile Express deals did relatively well. We were happy with our results and ready to start conceptualizing the future versions of the product.

      Shortening Time Windows - Less Uncertainty
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
At the time we introduced Express Deals, our opaque inventory had a sixteen-hour time window for all our flights. We knew this was a flaw and that if we could shorten the time windows even by a few hours, we could provide the user with more information (red-eye, same day, afternoon flights, etc) therefore more control over the flight.

  The New York Times wrote an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/travel/cheap-flights-budget-travel.html">interesting piece </a>on how to save money on flights and listed Priceline as an alternative for this.
