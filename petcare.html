      PetConnect is a feature concept that could very well live in any dog-sitting application. Its purpose is to connect owners and sitters beyond the service, by providing a tool for sitters to share images with their clients. By focusing on this feature, I aim to strengthen the owner-sitter relationship, and consequently make the service feel more “personal.”
      <br><br>
      I created the following prototype to explain and therefore sell the idea of PetConnect to other dog owners.

      Establishing Connection
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
    The challenge in establishing a connection between two users (owner to sitter) is thinking about the significance of such interaction for both. What kind of information do they need to see to not only understand the interface but also grasp its value immediately?

      Accepting Request
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
      Although I haven’t covered much of the onboarding process from the owner’s perspective, I feel the need to focus more on the sitter’s experience on this example. For an owner could understand the value by simply seeing: “This will help you see your dog when you are away.” However a sitter, having more “work” to do, needs to understand how her actions (taking a picture, messaging, etc) benefit her chances of getting rebooked in the future.

      Check In
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
      The first time a sitter enters a client’s home; she is prompted with a screen asking her to check in. I chose this approach to reinforce the meaning of this connection. I want the sitter to know the action she is committing to, as later on checking it becomes automatic.

      Taking a picture
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
    Currently the procedure to send a picture would be to, take a picture, jump into a messaging platform, attach the picture add a short message and finally send it. The challenge in creating this interaction was removing points of friction in the current user flow [for sending a picture].

      Conclusion
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
  Pet Connect is a feature I had in mind for over a year. It started with something I called Pet Care, which was just another dog-sitting application. It copied what <a href="https://dogvacay.com/">DogVacay</a> and <a href="https://www.rover.com/?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=brand&utm_content=Brand_General_Exact&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=270775618&utm_content=22973702818&utm_term=rover_e&adwordslocation=9004401&gclid=COWdvI2c9s0CFYpZhgod0JgIKg">Rover</a> were doing, with a slightly modified interface. The problem, though, does not lie entirely on the UI, rather on the service itself. People want to find capable sitters yes, but above all they want to find people they can trust with their pets. I shifted my focus from creating a dog-sitting app to simply targeting a small interaction (picture-taking) because I want to establish trust first and then figure out the ecosystem. These are all assumptions for now, but I am creating prototypes and testing constantly to prove  my direction.
