  <p>In 2015, I joined fab.com for a few months (on a freelance basis) to work on improving the navigation experience throughout its iOS application. I reported directly to the VP of product and together we brainstormed and elaborate on the problems
    I was to target in my time there. The tasks I had were: developing a better navigation and visual design throughout the application.</p>

  <h3 class="m-top">Problems with the navigation</h3>

  <p>The app relied upon on a collapsable menu, triggered by a hamburger icon, for its main/global navigation. The menu was stuffed, with what seemed to me, arbitrary links to specific product pages. As a first time user, I had noticed there was no
    clear or easy way to use the app, other than by searching for something specific. There was no easy way to explore by category, designer, or any attribute for that matter. My goal became to divide these entry points (hidden in the collapsable
    menu) into more logical sections.
  </p>

  <p>Another problem I encountered was that there’d be inconsistencies with what is displayed on the navigation bar. Search at times would be displayed in an “open field” state and at other times as an icon, in similar product pages.</p>

  <p>With the inconsistencies on the navigation bar came an endless number of back (left chevron) actions to perform to return to a shopping page and or search.</p>

  <p>After I had tinkered with the app’s navigation, I met with the sole stakeholder on this project to discuss the possibility of shifting from a hamburger menu to a more iOS compliant tab bar. This, I thought, would help create consistency across
    different paths of the app (no more inconsistencies on navigation bar) which in turn would make it easier for users to navigate.</p>

  <h3 class="m-top">Wireframes</h3>

  <p>I began sketching what the tab bar might look like, this wasn’t the difficult task of course. Thinking through each section, prioritizing the overlaps and potentially creating new landing pages was the difficult part.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <p>I iterated through versions where search would be embedded at the top, on the navigation bar, as well as on its own tab/category (at the bottom). I prioritized simplifying the top navigation bar by eliminating all secondary functionality from
    it (filtering, sorting, saving to list, sharing on social media, etc) and kept only what needed to be ubiquitous throughout the experience–in this case the cart for when something is added.</p>

  <h3 class="m-top">High-fidelity designs</h3>
  <p>I continued to work on refining the details for the navigation: adding color, consolidating on the name for each tab and reviewing for one last time the icons that were going to be used.</p>

  <h3 class="m-top">Conclusion</h3>
  <p>A year after I left, the designs I worked on went live, with some tweaks to the tab categories but similar visual direction. The app went through a complete redesign and after 2 years it was taken off the App store.
