  <p>littleBits is a startup that makes electronic building blocks–these snap together to create inventions. I worked at littleBits for a few months redesigning their main shopping landing pages. In my time there, I explored ways to further evolve
    the visual language by creating more versatile page layouts and juxtaposing imagery with fun subtle but compelling messaging.</p>

  <h3 class="m-top">Before starting</h3>
  <p>I walked through a hallway full of bits carefully glued to the walls. Once inside, I saw a display of bits–it was some sort of mini museum on the evolution of the bit. Then, I looked above the desks where employees were sitting; hanging from a wire I could see an invention (using these bits) moving back and forth. I was fascinated by the environment but became more so when I saw there was a lab in the office, with a 3D printer-this had to be the first one I had ever seen. Everything, to say the least, looked fun
    and vibrant.</p>

  <p>A few days later, after the orientation period, I began meeting with everyone–UX designers, PMs, developers, etc. At this point, it was important for me to understand who the users were; I inferred the users were children, however I didn't know how old. Where are we getting most of our purchases? I wondered. How and what do we think of the brand? I asked.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Before I knew, I was assigned to the redesign of new shopping homepage. The navigation was undergoing its own redesign, so new landing pages were needed for each one of the main sections: Bits, Kits, Accessories, Expansion Packs and the bitLab.</p>

  </figure>

  <h3 class="m-top">Shop all: landing page</h3>
  <p>After having sketched the ideas on my notebook, I created wireframes to think through the structure of the page and the content to be displayed. It was important to try different alternatives where certain sections could be emphasized more than
    others. All in all, the Shop all landing page was divided into 4 sections: about littlebits, top seller items(kits), the community and hero image to keep consistency with the style guide.

  <h3>Bits: shopping page</h3>
  <p>There are four main electronic bits–power, input, wire and output–all different colors and different in shapes. While working on this page, I explored different compositions for the hero section (using bits and images) and focused on creating unique but scalable responsive page layout.

<div class="container_modified m-top">
  <h3>Additional: shopping page</h3>
  <p>The additional shopping page converged three sections: accessories, expansion packs and bitlab products. To keep a consistent pattern, I used the same card treatment I had used on the Bits page. I also decided to use images with different background colors (these were the only ones available in the assets) to add more depth to the overall composition.</p>

<div class="container_modified m-top">
  <h3>Kits: shopping page</h3>
  <p>The final page I worked on was the Kits shopping page. After having done the work for both Bits and Additional, I had a pretty good idea as to how I was going to tackle the final designs for this page. The feedback so far had been positive and all stakeholders were satisfied with the visual designs so I proceeded to make the last page in the shopping experience.</p>
