      <div class="container_modified">

        <p>In 2016, while at Priceline, I joined a team of five in charge of redesigning the entire seat selection experience. My job, as the sole designer on this project, was to research, ideate, prototype and push the final visual designs. </p>

        <h3 class="m-top">Problem discovery</h3>
        <p>To better grasp the current user behavior, I reviewed the analytics in the old checkout flow and seat selection. In the data, I could see our conversion (for paid seats) and engagement dropping in the last five years. Other insights hinted at unusual number of rage clicks and session time-outs (these we presumed were due to bugs in the code). Later, I delved into the qualitative data in the form of open responses (on surveys) where seats or seat selection had been partially mentioned.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="../images/seats/old-seats-experience.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
            <figcaption>Old seat selection interface</figcaption>
        </figure>

            <p>Per the user feedback, we concluded that seats were, in fact, an important step in the process of booking a flight. However the majority of our users were either skipping seat selection or not finding it at all. Users skipped seat selection if it proved to be too slow (bugs and performance), too tedious (outdated and seemingly complex), or simply clicke "done selecting seats" by accident (continuing before selecting any seats). If users didn’t enter the seat selection step at all, we inferred the following: 1) it was never found, it’s not discoverable enough 2) it was found but the user preferred preferred selecting seats on their own perhaps later (potentially at the airlines’ websites).</p>

            </figure>

              <h3 class="m-top"> Ideating the entry point</h3>
              <p>I sketched and created wireframes proposing different alternatives for launching seat selection. Clearly, it would be somewhere in the checkout flow but the question was “where” in the flow The checkout flow had been overhauled and revamped almost from scratch, making it harder for us to coordinate efforts as we had to find a good medium in which both variables (seats and checkout) could ship on-time and within brand/business guidelines. </p>

              <figure>

              </figure>

              <p>Several brainstorming sessions later, we decided to go with Approach 1. Launching off a link from the first step in the checkout flow, was not an optimal solution. However, doing so allowed for a much faster implementation of both seats and checkout. Four months later, with our minimum viable product already live and working, we tested more alternatives for entering seat selection.  </p>

              </figure>

              <h3 class="m-top"> Sketching, wireframing and iterating</h3>
              <p>Having settled on the entry point, it was now time to start designing the seats. I focused on designing for mobile as I saw challenge in creating a layout that could work through different widths. In my research, I had also learned that the most popular seat configurations were the following: 3-3 and 2-3-2. This knowledge helped me focus on specific seat configurations and expand as I got the seats working at varying widths. </p>

              <figure>

              </figure>

              <p>Some airlines would go for a more minimalist experience, with little to no information about the aircraft type and/or layovers, etc. Some others opted for a more populated interface, with clever flight indicators and detailed flight information. For our minimum viable product, I aimed to design a minimalist experience, with essential components and information clearly laid out on the screen. As time went on, I would morph the current interface (either by adding or removing pieces of information) to further streamline the process.</p>

              <h3 class="m-top"> Finalizing our first version</h3>
              <p>“What is going to make us rise above other seat selection interfaces?” I kept asking myself. To do that, I had to first solve problems that were specific to us. As an OTA (Online travel agency) Priceline can only access airline seats through a third party service. The problem with the third-party service we used was that we wouldn't always get seats reliably. Errors happened and often. So before moving onto anything else, I reviewed all instances where an error may happen.  </p>

              <figure>
                  <img src="../images/seats/extra-features.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
                  <figcaption>Three main types of errors</figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>Fitting larger seat configurations (without sacrificing usability) into smaller devices (width of 320x) was nearly impossible. Knowing this, I opted for a quick but effective solution that would allow everyone access to any seat configuration (regardless of its complexity). </p>

              </figure>

              <p>After a month and a half of hard work, we launched the first version of seat selection. In the first week, we saw a rapid increase in engagement and a slight reduction in the time spent selecting seats. </p>

              </figure>

              <h3 class="m-top"> Selling seats</h3>
              <p>As a team, we had previously identified the key reasons for the low conversion on paid seats. The main problem we identified was that we weren’t offering the ability the purchase seats during the seat selection process–this effort required 5 (maybe 6) months to implement. The other problem was that we weren’t providing enough valuable information about each seat to prompt the purchase. My goal was to find the adequate amount of information to be displayed in a tooltip or modal, describing the benefits/perks of the seat selected.</p>

              <figure>
                  <img src="../images/seats/paid-seat-variations.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
                  <figcaption>Exploring different pop-up styles and information</figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>Earlier on, while working on the first version of seat selection, I had created some wireframes for paid seats in seat configurations. My conclusion was that we should test two approaches: one where the price was displayed (in the seat itself) and one where it was hidden until the tooltip came up. </p>

              <figure>
                  <img src="../images/seats/paid-seat-configuration.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">

              </figure>


              <p>While working through the interaction of selecting and deselecting paid seats, I thought about ways to keep track of the money being spent [on paid seats]. After some brainstorming sessions with other designers; I decided to prototype one idea to test the usability and accessibility myself. </p>

              </div>

              <p>Knowing it would take months for the final version of paid seats to be released, we decided to run an A/B test, aimed at improving conversion post-booking. The test was simple but effective. In the first week we sold more than 1000 paid seats–this was 30% better than our weekly sells in the past years. </p>

              <figure>
                  <img src="../images/seats/ab-test.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
              </figure>

              <p>After this A/B test, I finalized the designs for paid seating and moved onto analyzing more data to create a multi-passenger seat selection experience.</p>

              <h3 class="m-top"> Seat selection for multiple passengers</h3>
              <p>In the logs, I saw roughly 80% of users buying one ticket per flight, 15% bought two tickets per flight and less than 5% bought three or four tickets per flight. In our inventory of screen session captures (through FullStory) I could see users breezing through the process when buying one ticket but struggling a bit when buying for 2 or 3 passengers. The interface, we had created, was more efficient for one user buying one ticket, not for one user (or more) buying multiple tickets for different passengers.</p>

              <figure>
                  <img src="../images/seats/multiPass-userflow.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
              </figure>

              <p>I sketched ways to do 3 potentially 4 passengers selecting seats for one flight. This was difficult as I needed to clearly and elegantly indicate for whom the user was selecting a flight for and in which flight leg. </p>

              </figure>

              <p>After careful evaluation of the data we had captured using FullStory, I began to brainstorm ways to redesign the layout to further increase efficiency. I experimented with simplifying the components and information on the screen and used motion to emphasize the transitions happening at the passenger and flight levels.</p>

              <h3 class="m-top">Final designs</h3>
              <p>After refining the interactions, I moved onto polishing the final visual design. For this, I interacted with more stakeholders and tested with users to validate the ideas I was putting forth. A few of the things I worked on to finalize the interface were: seats’ contrast, exit rows and flight indicator placement. </p>
