      I got a contract to work @littlebits for a few weeks redesigning landing pages and contributing to the restructure of the global navigation. I have chosen to include this in my portfolio, as I believe my experience @littlebits summarizes my years of doing design at other smaller websites: mainly working on redesigning landing pages with minimal interactivity. The main difference this time is I had a mentor: a creative director with a print background, sharp in typography, well versed in color theory and overall composition.  He inspired me, in some way, to become a better designer by focusing on the smaller visual details.

      What's your favorite font?
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">

I was caught silent for a second; I had never been asked this question before. It makes sense for a designer to know this, but I wasn’t prepared. I had redesigned a logo, in a personal project, using the Pacifico font, so I said that. Before coming into the job I perused the website and had found they were using Futura as their font of choice. I asked then about this font selection and my creative director started telling a story. Here I was, unable to explain my selection for Pacifico, except for its noticeable friendly appeal, and he was going off about the feeling Futura elicits, and how well it blends with the overall brand.
<br><br>
I truly thought I would not be a fit and that the other two designers would make this difference in skills feel even more apparent. I wasn’t wrong about my assumption, however I persisted; I stuck around to learn from the man who could tell stories about fonts.

      Physical Product
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
      littleBits sells mini, magnetic electronics. They are used to build prototypes and I had fun playing with them at the office. On my second day at the job, I encountered my first challenge. I had designed websites for treatment centers, where the focus mainly was on the services being offered. I had also worked on a startup and at its core, building a feature, therefore a service, was its focus. I hadn’t yet designed to sell physical products. I found then that the focus in selling a small set of products is to simply concentrate on display (or at least that was our design direction).  It was e-commerce, in a smaller scale, because we had a limited set of products to offer. The focus was clear then, I’d iterate through a lot of small UI components and structure pages, always keeping in mind how well our products were displayed.
      <br>
      <br> I redesigned all the Shop section. This consisted of 4 (maybe 5) sub sections: wire, power, output, input and overall kits.

    Telling a Story
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
      The hundreds (if not thousands) of bits on the walls, the mini laboratory with a 3D printer, the little history museum and other extravagant things around littleBits confused me at first. I was given a fairly detailed tour before even getting interviewed at littleBits, I didn’t understand why; no other company had ever done this, especially not for a freelance gig.
      <br>
      <br>Almost at the end my contract, I was able to understand all of it; I was able to grasp the importance of telling a story. The reason why I accepted the job in the first place was because I wanted to know more about my creative director. I too wanted to tell a story, like he did about that font. I wasn’t able to do this before with other startups and smaller businesses, for they seemed to be more concerned about moving fast and simply getting the job done.  I missed out on the fun but now I understood it.
