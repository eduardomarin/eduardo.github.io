      <div class="container_modified">
        <p>Weeknder was the first responsive web application powered by Priceline and its goal was to create a new way to sell affordable weekend flights to flexible, spontaneous travelers. The idea for Weeknder had been around for a while, though with no resources, the product had never been actualized. In 2015, I joined a small team of 4 to brainstorm and (if possible) build an interface to test our ideas. The product of our work became Weeknder.</p>

        <h3 class="m-top">Discovery phase</h3>
        <p>Our target users were young, city people who wanted to get away on the weekend. In the travel industry, we called these: flexible travelers. To understand more about flexible travelers, we dug into our logs and reviewed analytics as to find when and how far in advance users were  booking flights. Then we discovered a moderate portion of our user base purchasing seats the same week (maybe 2 weeks at times) they were intending to fly. We decided to focus on these users for two reasons: : 1) we had the best deals then 2) we felt more comfortable building a product for users who were similar to us. </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="../images/weeknder/weeknder-personas.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
        </figure>

        <p>So far everything, in theory, sounded great. However, the biggest hurdle had not yet been addressed: the hidden flight information. The deals we accessed could not show certain information (exact time of departure, exact time of arrival, airline carrier and number of stops in layover) during the selection process. Only after the ticket was purchased would all the information be revealed.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="../images/weeknder/w-flight-difference.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
            <figcaption>The top result is a regular flight, the bottom is what an "opaque" flight would like like if styled similarly</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3 class="m-top">Explaning our deals</h3>
        <p>I decided to conduct a few user interviews to discover what it would take to get users to purchase these flight deals. In the interviews, I received feedback that was positive and consistent with what we had been thinking. We needed to be clear in our explanations and honest about the prices offered–no hidden fees, or sudden price surges when transitioning to Priceline, etc.</p>

        <figure>

            <figcaption>After much brainstorming with the team, we decided to add an About page with all the explanation about us as a team and the product itself</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Almost in parallel, we were ideating what the interface (which by now we all had a faint image of, by doing workshops for the About page) may look like. The questions we gathered to answer were: “What city do we start with? How many steps until checkout? When’s does the handoff to Priceline happen? How many screens (roughly) should we account for?.” Obviously, more questions came up after every conversation, so we had to constantly meet and discuss our ideas and plans.  </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="../images/weeknder/w-useflow.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
        </figure>

        <h3 class="m-top">Building the product</h3>
        <p>I began sketching and creating wireframes of what the layout would be for the homepage. I was tasked with finding different ways to lay out flights on the page, considering our audience and the primary use case for the product. I thought of using images, thinking it would add more depth to the experience. Also, I found this to be a great opportunity to rethink the information architecture and visual composition of flights’ results.</p>

        <figure>

            <img src="../images/weeknder/w-wireframe-2.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
        </figure>

        <p>Choosing the information to be displayed on the homepage came down to understanding what users intended to do at each level of the journey. At the homepage, I knew users would be trying to find the best deal by analyzing the “place” they wanted to go to and the “price” they would be willing to pay for it. I knew this from a survey conducted months before on Priceline flight’s path. Our flights were of course different than regular flights, but the rules still applied: destination and price were the most important pieces of information for our users. The number of stops, dates and exact times also helped in the decision making, but we could not reveal these until the ticket had been booked.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>The flight details page posed a challenge of its own. I focused on mobile first to think carefully about the layout and information architecture as it scales through different devices. I found it challenging to rearchitect information I was quite familiar with, from working on other Priceline features. I followed some brand rules but since Weeknder was separate from Priceline, I could explore different typefaces, shapes and more white space, etc. </p>

        <h3 class="m-top">Weeknder goes live</h3>
        <p>After 2 months, on January 2016, the first version of Weeknder went live. We ran an Instagram campaign with the hashtag #weeknder and got our first bookings the same week. </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="../images/weeknder/weeknder-live.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
        </figure>

        <h3 class="m-top">Alternative times</h3>
        <p>In user testing, we had heard the same sentiment over and over again: these were great deals but users needed more options to make the decision to purchase or not. Adding features to offer users more control over their itinerary was, therefore, a must for us. After much discussion with our business stakeholders we were able to expand our deals inventory. This meant we could now provide, more flights to the same destinations with shorter time windows.</p>
        <p>The task at hand was to go through our experience and figure out the right placement for different time windows. We met as a team again, brainstormed and put forth our ideas. Many of us were in favor of adding an input on the homepage to specify time windows. This idea however went against our vision to curate deals rather than search for them. Our concern with searching was that, if we allowed users to specify times, then the savings could potentially amount to nothing (below 5% savings). </p>
        <p>After much consideration, we decided to stick with our original curation model (keeping the homepage the same) and offered alternative time windows on the flight details page instead. The next step was to wireframe different ideas as to how we would lay out different flights (to the same destination) on the details page.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="../images/weeknder/w-alternative-desktop.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
        </figure>

        <p>To better scan through time windows, I proposed bucketing all different time windows into four different categories: morning, mid-day, afternoon, evening.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="../images/weeknder/w-alternative-final.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
        </figure>

        <h3 class="m-top">Similar destinations</h3>
        <p>In user testing, we also discovered that users wanted recommendations for similar destinations, when the deal they were looking was not convincing enough. This in theory, sounded like a great idea. But with only 50 destinations to choose from, recommendations, we thought, could become somewhat redundant. Nonetheless, I worked on some ideas to integrate the feature (which never really made it to production).</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="../images/weeknder/w-similar-destination.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
        </figure>

        <h3 class="m-top">More cities - expanding beyong New York</h3>
        <p>As we added more cities, we needed to grow the interface and that meant adding another step to the process. We were now providing more flexibility to our users and alleviating their uncertainty, one step at a time. For this part of the project, I began experimenting with other typefaces (Lato and Montserrat) as I wanted to further evolve our visual language.</p>

        </figure>

        <h3 class="m-top">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In creating Weeknder, I pushed through our then consistent but dry Priceline style guide by examining more mobile-friendly layouts, more efficient and scannable information hierarchy, and beautiful typefaces. The knowledge we acquired as a team, gathered through months of research and testing, helped another team (which I was fortunate to be a part of) effectively launch a similar product within Priceline–Express Deals.</p>
