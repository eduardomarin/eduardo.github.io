<h3 id="what-is-scopus">What is Scopus?</h3>

<p>Scopus is an international platform, part of the Elsevier research porfolio, where researchers of all levels (undergrad, PhD students, scientists, etc.) can search/analyze literature, find experts in a field, identify trends in research, and more.</p>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p>In 2017, I joined Elsevier.</p>

<p>Initially I worked on several small improvements to Scopus, including: a redesign to the search history page, addition of new searchable content, and an <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scopus-document-download/ojplelelocihfchkdaebocpankipadmp?hl=en-US">extension</a> to facilitate the download of documents. In time, due to the nature of my work, I moved to more search related projects, eventually ending up in a new team in charge of creating a new product offering from scratch.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="new-team">New team</h3>

<p>Early in 2018, I began working with different products (Mendeley, Science Direct to name a few) within the organization to create a new product offering for researchers. This new product would be focused on a simple but crucial use case: <strong>keeping researchers up to date with the latest research</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/scopus/query-interpretation.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The idea for the product was simple; a recommendation feed with some search capabilities.</p>

<p>I was in charge of integrating search. To do this I referred to the work I had been doing in Scopus and presented ideas to show how search could behave and what would be needed to make it “simpler”.</p>

<p>Search was important to this app, but like any feed-based product, it wasn’t the main focus.</p>

<p>In weeks, maybe months, we had discussed ideas like auto-suggest, natural language interpretation, keyword recommendations, etc. However with a contract on the line, we shelved some of these concepts and moved onto building a stripped down version of search. No fancy query interpretation, or boolean queries, just keywords that would be searched in artitle titles, abstracts and keywords related to the document.</p>

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/scopus/sutd-search.png" />
	<img src="/images/scopus/sutd-search-2.png" />
</div>

<p>Months later, the web app was released. And a month later the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elsevier.scopus_discovery&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Scopus Discovery app</a> was introduced as a mobile companion.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="back-to-scopus">Back to Scopus</h2>

<p>Late 2018, early 2019, I came back to work on Scopus.</p>

<p>Re-orgs had shifted priorities around. Search was still a priority, however there was a bit of hesitance to embark on projects that might take too long to accomplish. Also, with the Scopus Discovery App live, Scopus was left re-thinking its focus.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="document-results">Document results</h2>

<p>In times of uncertainty, we began thinking about the redesign of components, that are part of the Search and Discovery journey. The components we identified were: document results (patents, research articles, conference papers, reviews, etc.), filters, and features that helped users stay up-to-date (alerts, saving searches, etc.).</p>

<p>Redesigning document results required an understanding of all types of documents, in some cases in different languages and with varying information. Studies prior to this redesign, I learned we needed to improve the readability of our documents, so I left behind the tables and iterated upon a new format.</p>

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/scopus/scopus-results-final.png" />
	<img src="/images/scopus/scopus-results-in-progress.png" />
	<img src="/images/scopus/scopus-old-results.png" />
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>

<p>The first step in designing filters was deciding its importance in the page.</p>

<p>Then determining its usage by category. After some user sessions, we understood the frequency and the context for filtering. With a better understanding of user behavior, I put together ideas to demonstrate the placement and prominence of filters in the document results page.</p>

<div class="gallery" data-columns="2">
	<img src="/images/scopus/filters-bottom-drawer.png" />
	<img src="/images/scopus/filters-bubbles.png" />
</div>

<p>The next step in designing filters was figuring out how they were going to appear on screen. The proposals were either a drill-down (progressive disclosure) approach or a long page with tweaks to make it simpler.</p>

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/scopus/scopus-filters-all-in-one.png" />
	<img src="/images/scopus/scopus-filters-drill-down.png" />
</div>

<p>I created a few prototypes along the way to convey the experience to stakeholders. After several iterations, we came down to a longer page with certain additions (the slider for year ranges for example, which we saw as being a prevalent pattern on filtering documents). A graph behind the slider bridged the analysis and discovery use cases for documents in a subtle format.</p>

<p>The original experience would require users to check all the boxes first, then click a button to “Limit/filter” the results. Using this interaction model, users couldn’t see the impact each filter was having on results. The biggest change, that needed to happen, was being able see results update automatically as the checkboxes were tapped. And though easy to explain and prototype, this change required a massive re-implementation of filters. These changes continue to happen, we are gradually pushing to get to this ideal place.</p>

	<img style="width:50%" src="/images/scopus/filters-video.gif" />
	<img src="/images/scopus/filters-added-phone-screen.png" />
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="search">Search</h2>

<p>85% of the searches that happen on Scopus are for documents.</p>

<p>50% of users who arrive on documents results return to the homepage to modify their search.</p>

<p>Users saw Scopus as a reliable source of literature, however not as a “search engine.” And this in part was because Scopus had been built with control in mind (boolean operators, special characters and reserved keywords) for power users but not for the common, new researcher.</p>

<p>To make it easier for a common researcher, we needed to embrace a more forgiving and aiding search experience. One that recommended/suggested when needed, remembered what you had searched for before (to help you build a list of references) and validate immediately if a document is available in Scopus.</p>

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/scopus/search-suggestions-main.png" />
	<img src="/images/scopus/search-evolution.png" />
</div>

<p>I experimented with motion to ease the transition from an idle/inactive search input to an active search state. My intention was also to understand how we would/could incorporate motion into our design system.</p>

<div class="gallery gallery-gif" data-columns="2">
	<img style="width:50%" src="/images/scopus/search-animations.gif" />
	<img style="width: 50%" src="/images/scopus/search-animation-no-motion.gif" />
</div>

<p>I knew users were often changing their search, so we needed a more accessible way to get to the search box. A few iterations later, I came up with this idea which allowed users to focus on results when scrolling down but see both search and filters on the screen again as they started scrolling up.</p>

<div class="gallery gallery-gif" style="background-color:#EEF3F6; padding:4rem" data-columns="1">
	<img style="width: 30%" src="/images/scopus/search-disappears-with-filters.gif" />
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="giving-more-attention-to-retention-drivers">Giving more attention to retention drivers</h2>

<p>Some filters and actions to help users stay up to date were often misunderstood. We knew how much these could do for users, so I created guides to provide bits and pieces of explanation on some key, retetion-driving features (set an alert, save search, open access, etc.)</p>

	<img src="/images/scopus/demistifying-features-0.png" />

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Elsevier has many products in its portfolio, serving different needs in research. As designers, we aim to create components and interaction standards that we can re-use not only across teams but across products in the portfolio. I’ve been fortunate to have had the experience to work on Search experience (from redesigning the search boxes, to defining new patterns for filtering) and share these findings across different products. What I like about designing for search is the focus on abstraction. There’s little explanation or selling being done, it’s all about efficiency and clarity.</p>
