				<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>

<p>I had the pleasure of working at Looken, a startup based in Las Vegas, for a little over 4 months. The Looken platform has as its main focus a search engine that accrues multiple online deal providers (Groupon, Travelzoo, Amazon Local, etc) and adds some social elements (follow, like, comment, etc) to engage the user. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Defining location</h2>
<p>Knowing the user’s location is crucial in populating the site with relevant deals. The challenge, in this case, was elaborating a seamless process to capture a user’s exact location, given that the phone’s GPS for some reason failed to acquire this data. I went through some user flows and ended up with the following wireframes.</p>

<p><a href="/img/looken/location1.png" data-lighter="">
  <img src="/img/looken/location1.png" />
</a>
<span class="caption text-muted">First approach was to rely on GPS then if that failed a smart search box appear</span></p>

<p><a href="/img/looken/location2.png" data-lighter="">
  <img src="/img/looken/location2.png" />
</a>
<span class="caption text-muted">Second approach – I went a little more in detail as to find a location without using a phone’s GPS. I highlighted certain “hints” that would allow the user to see if a location was set or not.</span></p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Wireframing Deals</h2>
<p>While I believe a good visual composition is pleasing to the eye and can win over users, I also strongly believe there is far more significance in a useful interface than there is in a pretty one. While at Looken, I managed to wireframe various ‘finds’ (or deals), mobile being the focus most of the time. </p>

</a></p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Prototyping using Bootstrap</h3>
<p>A month into the job, I was asked to make some prototypes. I used the bootstrap framework as requested by my team. A few weeks later, I was learning different JS frameworks to help with the production code. </p>

</a></p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Where to focus</h2>

<p>There were three main components to the application: search, e-commerce and some lingering social features. Almost at the end of my stay, I began studying and researching similar platforms to find where our focus needed to be. I knew everyone expected to release this behemoth of an app altogether, but as time passed I had grown wary of our app’s utility. While I studied Kayak, Priceline, Cheaptickets and other similar useful platforms, I began obsessing over utility and search as a whole. “Deals, products, events among other things need to be targeted,” I thought. The fact of the matter is we needed something “superior” and ways to test our hypotheses. But sadly, there wasn’t time for that. </p>

</a></p>

<p><span class="caption text-muted">From time to time, after finishing working on something, I still sketch and prototype certain ways I could have done things better. This is how I envisioned Looken (of course just visually)</span></p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

<p>As a designer I saw potential in this startup. I knew it’d be a huge project to work on, for the magnitude of things involved. Ironically, the biggest problem lied in the amount of things to be designed and implemented [by a single person], as well as our inability to push updates on time. I worked in a team of 5 people where I was the only designer. This meant I was in charge of creating wireframes and graphic work for every part of the site. Somewhere along the line, I found myself more involved in front-end development than user experience, and this I felt was counterproductive for both the startup and myself. My stay in the startup was short-lived however the things I learned are invaluable.  </p>
