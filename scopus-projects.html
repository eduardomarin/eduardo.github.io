  </figure>

  <p>At Elsevier, I have worked on various projects, most in a product called Scopus. Scopus is Elsevier’s abstract and citation database. In essence, a search engine for scholarly, peer-reviewed literature. The work I have done has ranged from:
    designing a plugin (with ~250,000 downloads across different browsers) to improving our visual language and usability across the document search journey. One of my favorite projects has been working on redesigning the homepage, as this required
    most, if not all, teams to come together and re-conceptualize a page that has remained untouched for some years.</p>

  <h3 class="m-top">Scopus search homepage: Discovery phase</h3>
  <p>In surveys and on recorded calls (passed on to us by our line support) we received complaints on the difficulty first time users had performing simple queries on our search page. Librarians argued it took weeks, at times, to educate researchers on all the searching features we provided. Researchers, on the other hand, referenced other competitors (Google scholar, web of science and Microsoft academic) who had a more straightforward search page and search experience overall. </p>
  <p>The UX team gathered to discuss all the feedback that had been compiled, and later proceeded to created a deck to pitch a complete redesign of our search page.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>In a workshop with all stakeholders, we concluded we needed to rethink the entire experience to better cater researchers and enable power-users with a more succinct approach to searching. Some ideas that came up and I later explored were:
    improving search affordance and understanding of search capabilities, rethink our visual framework–make it more scalable and aesthetic, and lastly ideate new functions that would help users with specific searching needs (comparing journals,
    searching by ORCID, author, etc). </p>

  <h3 class="m-top">Sketching and wireframing a new homepage</h3>
  <p>Using a material-esque form for searching had received some complaints, as it was difficult to find in the midst of all the white space and noise. This was an opportunity to experiment with different shapes (mainly rectangles, with and without
    rounded borders) to improve the affordance and discoverability of our search box.</p>

    <img src="../images/scopus/SC-search-boxes.png" alt="seat maps finalized design" class="u-full-width">
  </figure>

  <p>For the most part, the designs I worked on didn’t deviate much from a traditional rectangular search box; I just tinkered with the height, contrast [with the background], whitespace between elements, drop shadows, and the overall shape of the
    rectangle(rounded, not rounded). Switching between categories was also a key component to searching on Scopus, I proposed some ideas to either enhance the tabbed design or simply ditch it for something different.</p>

  <h3 class="m-top">Experimenting with illustrations and images</h3>
  <p>To have a better grasp on the visual direction we wanted to pursue with this new redesign, I created a few versions of the top section of the homepage (where the search box was included) and presented them to the team for feedback. In this, I
    explored using illustrations, patterns and images.</p>

  <h3 class="m-top">Auto-suggest A/B test</h3>
  <p>Microsoft Academic and Google Scholar are perhaps the only true one-search-for-all approach to literature. Their vision to simplify the finding of authors, documents, journals, etc., lies in the use of semantic search through auto-suggest. At
    Scopus, we have been interested in moving towards that vision, but with a lot legacy code in our system and many users accustomed to boolean search, the change needed to happen incrementally. As a proof-of-concept, we decided to launch a quick
    A/B test, where we tested the addition of auto-suggest on the affiliations path. The key metric we looked at was the number or results leading to a details view of the affiliation (in a details page).</p>

  </figure>

  <p>In a few weeks, we saw dramatic increase of searchers leading to detailed results. In fact, as of now, eighty percent of the searches leading to detailed results, come from auto-suggest. </p>

  <h3 class="m-top">Resuming work on content for search homepage</h3>

  <p>In our previous workshop, we ideated on many possible new features and content. It was now time to prioritize those ideas based on user and business needs. The business prioritized the increase of registrations, while users desired a more
    intuitive search experience with less complexity and more personalized feedback/information (e.g. event news, scopus updates, error prevention, recommended content, etc). </p>

  <h3>About Scopus</h3>
  <p>This section is meant to establish Scopus’s authority and superiority over other similar products, by clearly laying out an overview of the content available on the platform. For first time users, this is a concise snippet of how much content
    is available for their research. </p>

  <h3>Non-logged in user content</h3>
  <p>For this section, I collaborated with marketing and other UX designers to piece together all the information we wanted to display for non-logged in users. We had an idea of what the page might look like, based on previous wireframes, we now
    had to prioritize the prominence of certain content on the page. I proceeded to explore different ways to layout the information (in cards or just whitespace) on the page and met with the team regularly for feedback and updates. </p>

  </figure>

  <h3 class="m-top">Logged in user content</h3>
  <p>Once we had established on the content and preferred layout for non-logged in users, it became much easier to design for the logged-in users. I borrowed and re-used ideas I had previously worked on and integrated them into this page. The main
    difference in this version was that we were including more personalized content for the logged in user, such as: alerts, recommender articles and author information.</p>

  <h3 class="m-top">Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Working on Scopus's homepage was not a top priority to begin with, hence it took over a year for the project to gain enough traction for me to begin work on it. My role throughout the project changed as I grew from researching and thinking through content, to actually creating the visual framework we would use for the homepage. The implementation of the homepage is currently underway and will culminate by early 2019. </p>
