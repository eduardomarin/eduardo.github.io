    <p>Express Deals are discounted flights ranging from 10 to 50+% savings. These flights are only available last minute and the catch is that we hide (per the airline’s request) certain flight information at the moment of booking. All information details are revealed once the purchase has been processed after booking the flight.<br /></p>

<h2>Intro to Express Deals &amp; Approach</h2>
<p><br />
Express Deals was a fast project. There were many technical constraints and not many resources. However the idea for it was great. The approach was simple: lay the cheapest express deal on top of the flights results page. My job then was to figure out how to design this express deal flight with less information than normal.</p>

<h2>Details Page - Recycling Old Page</h2>
<p><br />
We reused a lot of old code and existing pages in this launch.  As a designer, I also compromised by recycling the old details page and making it so that it would work for us. My approach was to simply introduce some text explaining what express deals are.

<h2>Express Deals - Mobile</h2>
<p><br />
After the desktop launch we had peaked “opaque” flights sells like never before. Everybody was happy, and flights had established a new way to sell flight deals. With desktop done, I approached mobile (as not everything was responsive then yet) with the same “integrated” approach.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>Express Deals - Better time windows (V2)</h2>
<p><br />
In a previous usability test, we found that wide departure time windows (6am- 10pm) were an issue.  With the momentum we had amassed and the help of the business, we managed to convince airlines to shorten these windows to 8 hours. Now we could bucket time windows into categories: morning, afternoon and night. This idea was first tested on Weeknder and later made it to Express Deals, making a great success.</p>
