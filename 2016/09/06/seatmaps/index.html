    <p>Seat selection / Seat maps has been the most difficult, most rewarding experience I have had since I started my career. As the sole designer, I took seat maps through 3 major releases, and accomplished goals that not only benefited the growth of the business but also demonstrated what we can achieve on the web by pushing harder and working together.  <br /><br /></p>

<h2>Initial Meetings</h2>
<p><br />
Our initial meetings aligned the team on one vision and strategy for launch. We drafted main user flows and talked about feasibility from different perspectives.</p>

<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
<p><br />
After coming together and distilling the scope and requirements of the project, I began analyzing other airlines and pulling data from our then desktop experience to better understand patterns and common interactions.</p>

<h2>Sketches</h2>
<p><br />
At this point, most of the general, low-fi wireframes were drafts on my notebook. The main challenge in making this experience responsive, was figuring out exactly what components could and couldn’t fit on a phone.</p>

<h2>Building out the experience</h2>
<p><br />
I focused on keeping the interface as clean as possible by prioritizing pieces of information, deriving common patterns that would work across all widths and making the visual language easy and self-explanatory.</p>

<h2>Seat Maps - V1</h2>
<p><br />
It took approximately a month and half to launch this version of seat maps.  Our goals and expectations were to make this an efficient, more visually appealing experience, and I believe we accomplished that.<br /></p>

<h2>Seat Maps - V2 (Premium Seats)</h2>
<p><br />
Seat Maps V2 was more so a technical effort than a design challenge. Previous to this, we didn’t have an infrastructure set up to purchase “premium seats” in checkout. We did however have the ability to process a purchase after booking. In an effort to prove our users’ intent for purchasing premium seats, we ran an A/B test introducing the idea of “locked premium seats”.</p>

<p>The test was positive and we for once sold more than 1000 premium seats in a week.</p>

<p>I worked concurrently on ways to introduce premium seats in checkout. We opted for going with the simplest approach as images and other elements would not be provided by the airlines on time for the projected launch.</p>

<h2>Seat Maps - V3 (Multi Passenger Experience)</h2>
<p><br />
Up to now, we had an experience that could only handle one passenger at a time. In trying to make the experience more efficient, I began brainstorming ways to introduce multiple passengers in one concrete flow.</p>

<p>Most of the changes I made were based on data we had collected on user interaction and behavior.</p>

<p>The following are sketches I made thinking more “modularly” about the components on the page.</p>

<h2>Seat Maps - Progressive Visual Iterations</h2>
<p><br />
I’m working on improving the aesthetics of our current seat maps body and brainstorming ideas we could potentially test into.</p>
