    <p>Looken was the smallest startup I’ve ever joined. The team was 6 people, most of them engineers including the CEO; I was the only designer and front-end developer.  At the time we were trying to build a platform that accrued deals (like Groupon) from various providers. The main difference was in that we’d cover not only products but services and events as well<br /><br /></p>

<h2>First Project - GPS Disabled</h2>
<p><br />
I worked on many projects in parallel to this one. It wasn’t too often that I made wireframes; I mostly drafted things, mocked them up and jumped straight to code. I didn’t need to spec things out after all. These are one of the few explorations I was tasked with for the input of a user’s location if GPS is somehow disabled.</p>

<h2>Wireframe to Code</h2>
<p><br />
I sketched out things first, created wireframes and jumped straight to seeing how we could build this in Angular. Thinking simultaneously about performance and usability made things a bit more difficult but effective somehow.</p>

<h2>Responsive Modules</h2>
<p><br />
A lot of the visual iterations happened in CSS. Making something responsive after all is much easier when the canvas you are working with is dynamic.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><br />
My experience at Looken was invaluable. Working with so few people, so many ideas and immense amounts of autonomy, so much passion just to “make it happen.” I left Looken knowing the kind of designer I wanted to become and what I wanted to impact.</p>
