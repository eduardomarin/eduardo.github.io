    <p>Weeknder, a responsive web application powered by Priceline, explores a new way to find and purchase discounted flights.  As the sole designer in this project, I conducted research, built the entire UI and introduced ideas that later would be used in another flagship product: Express Deals.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>Experience Overview - Modular Design</h2>
<p><br />
The entire experience consisted of 3 main pages. The first page, the landing/home page, displayed flight deals from NYC to popular cities in the US. In designing this first page I opted for creating modules that would easily scale through different widths.</p>

<h2>Home Page</h2>
<p><br />
I had complete control and freedom to create and choose the content I wanted on this page. I decided to use images as I felt they’d give our users a better understanding of the preselected, available destinations. Furthermore, I believed images could create an “inspiring” feel to the app. However, the question now was: “what kind of images do we use?” We settled for skyline images, as we identified these were more recognizable and reinforcing.</p>

<h2>Details Page</h2>
<p><br />
The challenge in creating this page was figuring out the information structure and how much of a priority each component should have.</p>

<h2>Weeknder - V2 (More Departure Cities)</h2>
<p><br />
Introducing more departure cities meant adding another page to the flow. My inspiration at this point was Airbnb. I built therefore a welcoming homepage with an easily recognizable selector.</p>

<h2>Weeknder - V3 </h2>
<p><br />
After conducting a usability test, we made major changes to all the pages in the flow. Research would shape later versions of the product and make things much simpler. On version 3 of the app, I focused primarily on simplifying the UI by refining the pieces of information at each step of the process.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/weeknder/w-7.png" alt="weeknder homepage" /><br /></p>

<p>A problem we had was that users would focus too much on the hero and less on the destinations. I needed to deemphasize this by taking the picture away and making it a simpler component.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/weeknder/w-8.png" alt="weeknder homepage" /><br /></p>

<p>I had introduced the idea for “bucketing time windows” at Express Deals (fifth project on this portfolio) and the idea was now to test it on Weeknder and see how it did. The idea was successful as proven by user interaction and conversion. <br /><br /></p>

<p>The following is a future version of the app, in which users can toggle time windows and “customize” therefore a flight deal.</p>
