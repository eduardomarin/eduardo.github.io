    Weeknder is a responsive web application we built (internally at Priceline) and iterated on for a span of 5 to 6 months. Our initial goal was to create a platform where people could find weekend flight deals. As we went through 3, maybe 4, versions we lost focus of our core value, lost our resources and ended up failing. <br><br>
    I chose this project to be on my portfolio because I believe I learned a lot from it; perhaps more than any other project I’ve been in.

      Weeknder V1 (Trippy)
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
    The idea for spontaneous weekend trips had been around for a while, and there was data supporting its demand yet nobody had consolidated on a plan to role out a product. We (a team of 5 people with no name at the time) met up to talk about the possibility of building this in a month. As it is customary at Priceline, we must prove our concept first in order to gain resources.

      Weeknder V2 – Catching on fire
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
    Weeknder began catching on. After our first launch, we had some traffic on the site and I believe a few bookings. Our numbers weren’t as hot as we thought they’d be, but we noticed something: everyone in the product team was rooting for our success. In a sense, Weeknder was the first product to get build out without a solid business case. Usually everything starts on the business side and the product folks just take on the tasks assigned. Weeknder was the exception and everyone loved it.
      <br>
      <br> I believe it was around this time things began to break down. In a week, I believe we added 10 origin cities (from just having one: NYC) filter controls, lessened our time windows and were looking to add alternate airports in the upcoming weeks. I don’t know how we were prioritizing things at this point.

      Weeknder V3 – Usability Test
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
  I don’t know when it was that we realized we couldn’t move forward anyore. I think we knew all along we were laying pieces on top of each other without a solid base. It was time to figure out what to prioritize and how. We opted for a usability test. For a week I just worked with our researcher on building out our testing plan and during the process we uncovered the usability flaws we’d later confirm in the results [of the usability test]. There was no time to sit back and ponder on what-ifs; we needed to start simplifying our interface.

  There’s not much to say. We haven’t launched this version yet. In fact, I don’t know if we’ll get to do so. After all our resources left and the flame died down a bit, Weeknder remained stagnant.

      Conclusion
    </div>
    <div class="project_body_text">
    
      Indeed, there are good things that came with building Weeknder.  I recycled the idea for bucketing time bands and using alternate airports on Express Deals. This proved to be successful for the growth of the product and the business as whole. In development, we discovered a better way to build a cache engine, and now are in talks to build a new one for the entire deals team. As a designer, I learned to focus. It sounds simple, but in an ever-changing environment, where we have to juggle expectations, learning to focus is incredibly important.
